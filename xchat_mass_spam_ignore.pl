# Description: Convert highlight events to normal events if more than a set number (4) nicks
#              are present in the highlight line. This script will also eat common /names
#              spam, and so does not require the other script

# Version History
# 001  2010-02-01 Initial Version
# 002  2010-02-01 does an actual ignore on a specific spamming form, which spams the /names
# 003  2010-02-01 support for cap identify-msg (regardless of if set or not), better delay
# 004  2010-02-02 Now will not change the tab color, even with the bug in XChat

# default value left at 4, due to presense of generic nicks on channels, like "stats" and "bot"
